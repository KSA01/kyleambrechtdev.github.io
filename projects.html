                <h3>Associated with time as DAST Consulting Services</h3>
                <p>
                    Assisted on further developing features to a SMS based prompt service app for students to chat with using emojis to describe how they feel to encourage students or users to continue interacting with the platform by gaining a streak and earning 
                    badges and such. Aims to help students with stress and depression by giving them an anonymous chat experience that ultimately feels human. Some examples of features I worked on were bug fixes and further customization of the settings for users
                    page as well as the implementation of a community dashboard for admins viewing page and a system status page for monitoring.

                <h1>Hangman Game</h1>
                <h3>01/2024 - 4/2024</h3>
                <h3>Associated with Jessup University</h3>
                <p>
                    Created a fully interactive game of hangman using Python and its libraries such as pygame, random, and numpy. I implemented a fully functioning word difficulty analyzer found online to classify words to easy, medium, or hard. 
                    The game demonstrates creativity as well as ease of navigating the game by having many access buttons displayed on the screen telling the user what they each do and a rules page explaining what everything does, is for, and how all 
                    aspects work. This all creates a fully interactive for the user rather than a simplistic game that is traditionally straightforward this still is that at basic levels but adds many more features and customization.

                <h1>3D Tetris Game</h1>
                <h3>9/2023 - 11/2023</h3>
                <h3>Associated with Jessup University</h3>
                <p>
                    Created a 3D version of the game Tetris using Python, OpenGL, and Graphics Card Language. Uses the arrow keys to move the blocks on the screen and the wasd keys to rotate the objects on the screen. It will randomly choose an object 
                    shape each time regardless of the last one, show you the next one up, and keep all objects (squares) on screen once they've hit the bottom unless you manage to fill a row completely with the shapes in the game.

                <p>
                    A text-based adventure game filled with images as you traverse through rooms while exploring a cavern, which includes defeating enemies, and bosses, and finding and claiming useful materials, weapons, and protection. 
                    Includes a classic tomb explorer theme which has a map showing the player where they have explored.
