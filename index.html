                <p>Software Engineer | Web Developer | Cloud Enthusiast | AI</p>
                <p>
                    Hey there! I’m a passionate Software Engineer with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from William Jessup University in Rocklin, CA, working towards my future in the technology industry as a programmer. I am currently working out of Lincoln CA 
                    which is my hometown where I was raised and where I love to participate in my local community activities.

        <h2>My Personal Statement</h2>
        <p>
            My goal is to be able to partake in creating something larger than myself that gives me a sense of purpose in fields that interest me and what best fits my skill set. I desire to do such through programming and investing my time in technology as 
            I see it as a huge aid to our future because technology paves the way for us to grow, learn, and connect. I strive to continue working diligently, accomplishing tasks on time, and doing whatever is asked of me. Through my work experiences, I have 
            accustomed myself towards providing customers with a great experience, as the customers happiness makes me happy. I go above and beyond what is asked of me by completing tasks that are more urgent and involve the skillsets I possess. Through customer 
            service, I have mastered skills such as managing stress in the workplace, handling difficulties, and handling customer/peer interaction. Through positivity and kindness, I have seen how it impacts customers and peers firsthand in a positive light.
