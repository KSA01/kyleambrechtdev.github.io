        <div class="about-section-large">
        <h3>
            I'm a passionate software engineer with expertise in Python, JavaScript, and cloud technologies with a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science from William Jessup Univiersity. I specialize in mainly software programming as well 
            as building scalable web applications and have a deep interest in cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, Oracle), automation (Terraform, CI/CD), and cybersecurity. 
        </h3>
        </div>
        <p> 
            For many years of my life, I have been involved in technology as my fatherâ€™s work kept him tech-savvy and he was a specialist with computer software and technical data for aircraft. This allowed me to learn about modern technology, 
            how to understand and use it, and how it benefits us.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a lover of outdoor and indoor activities as my passions involve both, I have always enjoyed playing games and learning about technology while also spending time outside with other 
            hobbies such as sports and automotive interests. I grew up playing soccer which led to me supporting my local soccer community and even volunteer helping coach youth boys soccer. I actively participate in my local Soccer Sunday League where I enjoy 
            spending time with my friends and building new friendships with my teamsmates, which also helps builds on my cooperation skills. I also share an interest in any automobile and tinkering with them just like my father who taught me almost 
            everything there is to know about working on cars, getting your hands dirty, and working hard to get the job done.
